        "Then, I learnt Java/Android and built a basic quiz app which almost everyone in my class used to prepare for one of our class tests. Then I spent the next few months hopping from one technology to another.",

        "Finally, In 2021, I ventured into the wonderful world of web development, learning the basics and eventually moving over to the MERN stack and Nextjs. I continuously look for avenues to learn new tech and improve my existing knowledge."
